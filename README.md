# Rentals in Metropolitan Areas

Due to the significant inflation observed in 2022-2023, rental prices have surged noticeably. As a result, many tenants are finding it increasingly challenging to afford their current rentals, prompting them to seek more affordable options in suburban areas. However, this transition to suburban living often means sacrificing proximity to essential amenities such as public transportation, shopping centers, and dining establishments.

Recognizing these challenges, I have embarked on a project to collect rental data from the home.com website. The goal is to create a comprehensive price comparison application that can empower tenants to make informed decisions about their next place of residence. By factoring in their preferences, including the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and location, this tool will help tenants identify housing options that align with their needs and budgetary constraints.
